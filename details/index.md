            <p    >Let’s start with the most important information: what do you need to do to pass the course? You need to pass 4 online quizzes, pass the final exam and complete a group project.<br></p><p    >If you do this, you get two grades: one for the combined quizzes and exam, what we call the “examination” part of your grade, and one for the final project. If both grades are high enough, your final grade is the average of the two.<br></p><p    ><br></p><p    ></p>

            <figcaption>
            <p    >Here are the rules in detail. <br></p><p    >For the exam and quizzes you score points: 10 each for the quizzes and 40 for the exam, for a maximum total of 80 possible points. You need to score at least 52 points to pass, which corresponds to a 5.5. To support the exam and the quizzes, there are <em>homework exercises</em>. You can make these to prepare, but these are not graded. The answers are provided, so it’s up to you how you use them. There are weekly homework sessions to discuss the homework with your TA.<br></p><p    >The project is done in groups of 5. Here, the minimum grade is 4.5. Note however, that the minimum final grade is a 5.5, so if your project grade is this low, you will need to get a higher examination grade so that the average of the two is 5.5 or higher. The project is supported by group sessions, which start in the second week of the course.</p><p    ></p>

            <figcaption>
            <p    >The grading system, despite our best efforts, is a little complex. This occasionally leads to some misunderstandings. These are the most common ones. <br></p><p    >First, <strong>scoring half the available points is not enough to pass</strong>. There is no rule that says that half the points should correspond to a passing grade. In our case, we’ve found that a pass mark of 52 points for the quizzes and the exam together, means you’ve learned the minimum required subject matter.<br></p><p    >Second, the fact that you can get between 0 and 10 point for each quiz <strong>does not mean that these represent grades</strong>. That is, if you get 6 points for a quiz, that doesn’t mean you’re on your way to a <em>grade</em> of 6. The points get added to the total, and the total needs to be higher than the pass mark. <br></p><aside    >Getting 6 points for every quiz means that you’ll need to score 28 points on the exam. This is a relatively high score, so it’s advisable to aim a little higher than this for the quizzes.</aside><aside    ></aside>

See <strong>Practice Exam A</strong> on Canvas for details. The main thing to worry about are the <em>application</em> questions.

            <p    >Finally, we’d like to point a few things that often show up in evaluations, and what we do about these points of criticism.<br></p><p    >The first complaint we often hear is that the course is too difficult and requires a lot of math skills. When possible we try to simplify the course in response without watering it down too much. In the last two years, two complex topics have been removed. <br></p><aside    >You can still see these lectures on the website if you’re curious.<br></aside><p    >We ask program directors to check that students have at least <em>some </em>background in probability, calculus and linear algebra before adding this course to their program. Still. for some people that means having had calculus in high school, or having to recall a linear algebra course that wasn’t very successful. We do our best to give you time to brush up on your preliminaries before we get into the hard math.<br></p><p    >The flipside of this is that we have certain goals to achieve. We don’t just need to convey machine learning, many of you are going to do a master soon, where the math level is much higher. If we hold back now, you will only suffer more next in the master. In short, there is a limit to how much simpler we can make the course. <br></p><p    >On the other side, we also hear that the course is <em>too simple</em>. More specifically, that despite all the complicated stuff we talk about, you only really need to master a small subset of the material in order to pass. It’s important to realize that this is <em>by design</em>. Doing this is not cheating. We carefully choose a subset of the material as primary learning goals. Knowing these inside and out will get you a passing grade, and the better you know the rest, the closer you get to a 10. This is is how courses are <em>supposed</em> to work. Especially a course like this, with so many students from so many different backgrounds.<br></p><p    >Another point we saw a lot last year, is that for the open quiz questions, there is little feedback form the TAs to justify the grades. We can’t give individual feedback for two reasons. First, it’s simply too much work (remember, we have to mark 700 quizzes per work), and second, the TAs aren’t qualified to argue with students about grades, and explicit feedback invites a certain amount of arguments.<br></p><p    >What we will try instead this year, is to have a general feedback session as part of the homework groups. Here, the TA points to specific issues that we encountered a lot during marking. You can also ask the homework TA to have a look at your submission, if there’s time, but remember they are not the TA that marked your quiz.<br></p><aside    >One other criticism we received is that hosting the videos on Youtube requires students to watch a lot of ads. This year, we will try to host the embedded videos on an alternative platform, so that ad-free viewing is also possible. </aside><aside    ></aside>

            <p    >To illustrate the course difficulty, here are the average passing grades and the pass percentages of previous years. Note that these do not point to a disproportionately difficult course. In fact, some years are a little higher than what would be expected from a sufficiently challenging course.<br></p><aside    >These are the percentages of active students that passed, and the average grades among that percentage of students who passed<br></aside><p    >This doesn’t mean we don’t sympathise if you find the course difficult, or that we think it’s your own fault. We are always happy to help, and we strongly believe everybody should be able to learn these concepts. It’s just that these numbers don’t indicate that there is a serious problem, or that an overhaul is called for.<br></p><aside    >Nevertheless, last year, we decided to remove some of the more technical subjects which have become less relevant in the last few years: support vector machines, and with them Lagrange multipliers. We decided not to replace these by other subjects, but instead to give the remainder a little more room to breathe. This will hopefully lighten the load a little.<br></aside><aside    >This year, we removed the Expectation Maximization algorithm, and replaced it by the topic of Transformers. The latter is more relevant to modern AI and hopefully a little simpler.<br></aside><p    ><br></p><p    ><br></p><aside    ></aside>

            <p    >So, if you find yourself overwhelmed by the material, what should you do? Note first, that it's perfectly possible and acceptable to pass the course without understanding all the ins and outs of every topic discussed. <br></p><p    >Quite often, the slides aim to provide a <em>complete</em> story so that if you need to know all the details about a certain topic, you have them in a self-contained package. That doesn't mean, however, that you always need to understand all details of every subject. You can often skip the technical details, so long as you understand the larger message. <br></p><aside    >You don't always need to know how to get from A to B, so long as you understand what A and B are, and why it's important to get from one to the other.<br></aside><p    >To help you separate the wheat from the chaff, please look at the <strong>practice exams </strong>early on. They will help you to understand what it is you should focus on, if you find that the whole of a lecture is too much to digest. <br></p><p    >When it comes to following complex mathematical derivations, please note that it gets easier with practice. Maybe it takes you an hour to follow all the steps in a single slide the first time around, and your heart sinks at the prospect of doing that several times for every lecture. However, if you persevere, it will get easier very quickly, and before long, it will be second nature.<br></p><p    >Lastly, the practice of recording videos may give the unfortunate impression that all material can be absorbed by passively watching a video. You should expect to get as much out of watching the videos passively as you get out of attending a live lecture. It should be enough to set the stage, and to give a skeletal understanding of the subject, but to get the details, an active approach is necessary: you need to watch with pen and paper ready, and you'll have to frequently pause. Hopefully, the lecture notes can help with this part of the process.</p><p    ></p>
