            <p    >We’ll focus mostly on <strong>binary classification </strong>today (two-class classification). In this case, we can think of the classifier as a detector for one of the classes (like spam, or a disease). We tend to call this class positive. As in “testing positive for a disease.”<br></p><p    >In classification, the main metric of performance is the proportion of misclassified examples (which we’ve already seen). This is called the <strong>error</strong>. The proportion of correctly classified examples is called the <strong>accuracy</strong>.<br></p><p    ></p>

            <figcaption>
            <p    >So the first thing we do in machine learning is <strong>withhold</strong> some data. We train our classifiers on the <span>training data</span> and test on the <span class="blue">test data</span>. That way, if we get good performance, we know that we’re likely to get a good performance on future data as well, and we haven’t just memorised random fluctuations in the training data.<br></p><p    >How should we split our data? The most important factor is the size in instances of the<span class="blue"> test data</span>. The bigger this number, the more precise our estimate of our model’s error. Ideally, we separate 10 000 test instances, and use whatever we have left over as training data. Unfortunately, this is not always realistic. We’ll look at this a little more later.</p><p    ></p>

            <figcaption>
            <p    >But even if we withhold some test data, we can still go wrong. We’ll use k nearest neighbours (kNN) as a running example. Remember, kNN assigns the class of the k nearest points. <br></p><p    >k is what is called a <strong>hyperparameter</strong>. We need to choose its value in some way before we run the algorithm. The algorithm doesn't specify how it should be chosen. One way of choosing k is to try a few values, and to see for which k we get the best performance.</p><p    ></p>

            <p    >The same models, different test sets and the conclusions are entirely different.

            <figcaption>
            <p    >This is essentially the overfitting problem again. Our method of choosing the hyperparameter k is just another learning algorithm. By testing so many values of k on such a small amount of test data, we are overfitting our choice of k on the test data. The model we choose fits well because of random fluctuations in the data. When we resample the data, these fluctuations disappear and the performance drops.<br></p><p    >This is an instance of the<em> multiple testing</em> problem in statistics. We’re testing so many things, that the likelihood of a noticeable effect popping up by chance increases. We are in danger of ascribing meaning to random fluctuations. <br></p><p    >Specifically, in our case, the k=1 classifier <strong>got lucky</strong> on a few examples, that just happened to fall on the right side of the decision boundary. If we draw some new data, the same classifier won't be lucky again. The more different values of k we try, the more we are in danger of this kind of random luck determining which hyperparameters come out as good.<br></p><p    >The simple answer to the problem of multiple testing is<strong> not to test multiple times</strong>.<br></p><p    >see also: <a href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/882:_Significant"><strong class="blue">https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/882:_Significant</strong></a><br></p><p    ></p>

            <p    >This means that you need to test which model to use, which hyperparameters to give it, and how to extract your features <strong>only on the training data</strong>. In order not to evaluate on the training data for these evaluations, you usually split the training data <strong>again</strong>: into a (new) <strong>training set</strong> and a <strong>validation set</strong>.<br></p><p    >Ideally, your <span>validation data</span> is the same size as your <span class="blue">test set</span>, but you can make it a little smaller to get some more <span>training data</span>.<br></p><p    >This means that you need to <strong>carefully plan your research process</strong>.

This is not always the case however, so if you use a standard benchmark you should check if this is allowed, and if you use your own dataset, you should describe carefully whether you do this.<br></p><p    >Note that this approach by itself doesn't <em>prevent</em> multiple testing. It just provides for a final failsafe to <em>detect</em> it. Before you make the decision to try your model on the test data, you should first convince yourself that the results you see are not down to multiple testing. You can do this by not testing too many hyperparameter values, or if you fear that you have, by rerunning your experiment on a different <span>train</span>/<span>validation</span> split to double-check.<br></p><p    >There's always a bit of a tense moment when you run the experiment on the <span class="blue">test data</span>, and you get to find out how close the real numbers you'll get to report are to the numbers you've seen for the <span>validation</span>.

            <p    >The first is the difference between the <strong>true metric</strong> of a problem or task, and the <em>value you measure</em>. This is a very basic principle in statistics. For instance, we can’t observe the mean height of all Dutch people currently living, but we can take a random sample of 100 Dutch people, and use their average height as an <strong>estimate of the true average height</strong>.  <br></p><p    >To translate this to machine learning, let’s take classification accuracy as an example.<br></p><p    >We usually imagine that the data is <strong>sampled</strong> from some distribution p(x). In this view, we're not really interested in training a classifier that does well on the dataset we have, even on the test data. What we really want is a classifier that does well on any data sampled from p(x).<br></p><p    >Imagine sampling one instance from the data distribution and classifying it with some classifier <span>C</span>. If you do this, there is a certain probability that <span>C</span> will be correct. This is called the<strong> true accuracy</strong>. It is not something we can ever know or compute (except in very specific cases). The only thing we can do is take a large number of samples from p(x), classify them with <span>C</span>, and approximate the true accuracy with the relative frequency of correct classifications in our sample.

            <p    >One way of doing this is to compute a <strong>confidence interval</strong>. Here we see the process of computing a sample accuracy in a simple animation: we start with the true accuracy (for some given classifier, on the data distribution) which is somewhere between 0 and 1. We sample a bunch of points from the data distribution (our test set), and take the relative frequency of correctly classified instances as the <strong>sample accuracy</strong>.<br></p><p    >Here, in the top half of the slide we model the process of taking one instance of our test set and seeing whether the classifier classifies it correctly as a single random draw resulting in the outcome<span class="red"> </span><span>correct</span> or <span class="red">incorrect</span>. <em>We'll see in the next lecture that this type of distribution is called a Bernoulli distribution.</em><br></p><p    >The whole process of sampling the entire test set and computing the sample accuracy is also a random process. If we were to repeat it, sampling a new test set, we'd get a different value for the sample accuracy. To simplify this, we can look at the total number of instances in our sample that the classifier classified correctly (so we don't divide by N). In that case, it turns out we can work out the distribution of this process as well: the number of "<span>correct</span>"s we get in N samples from a Bernoulli distribution forms what is known as a Binomial distribution.<br></p><p    >The technical details aren't important. The main message is that we can define precisely what distribution we can expect on the value of the sample accuracy of we keep the classifier and the true accuracy fixed, but resample the test data. In this case, we see that for a true accuracy of 0.8, and a test set of N=10 instances, we are most likely to see that the classifier correctly classifies 7 instances in our sample (as we did in the top half of the slide). However, it's also perfectly possible to see 5, 6, or 8 instances classified correctly.<br></p><aside    >This is a complicated picture with multiple random processes going on. Take a little time to wrap your head around this before moving on.<br></aside><p    >Imagine that if we have two classifiers, and we compute sample accuracies for both on a test set of 10 instances. We get 5/10 correct for one classifier and 8/10 correct for the other. Can we conclude that the first is definitely worse than the second? What we see here is that if they <em>both</em> have a true accuracy of 0.8, it would be perfectly likely to see these numbers. In short, with such little test data, we have much uncertainty around our estimate of the true accuracy.<br></p><p    >One way to quantify this uncertainty is to draw a <strong>confidence interval</strong>. This is simply any interval on the values of our sample accuracy that captures a given proportion of the probability mass, usually 95%. You can draw the confidence interval anywhere you like so long as you decide how to draw it before seeing the data. The most common approach is symmetrically around the mean, but you can also start at the mean and extend it to the right as far as possible or to the left as far as possible.<br></p><p    >The confidence interval captures our uncertainty. We don't know the true value of the accuracy, and we can't estimate it very accurately, but we know it's most likely one of these values.<br></p><p    ></p>

This means that even if we report 0.5 as the accuracy, we may well be wrong by as much as 0.1 either side.<br></p><p    >Even if these confidence intervals are usually not reported, you can easily work them out (or look them up) yourself.

This gives us a confidence interval that isn't as correct as the true confidence interval, and one that would change slightly if we were to resample the test set, but we can at least compute it, and it generally behaves in roughly the same way as the true confidence interval.</p><p    ></p>

It is simply an objective, determined value (which we don’t know). The probability comes from sampling, and from computing the interval from a sample.<br></p><p    >So instead of having a fixed interval, with the true mean jumping around probabilistically, we have a fixed true mean around which we get an interval that jumps around if we resample the data. The probability of it jumping so much that it no longer contains the true mean is 5%.<br></p><aside    >This is typical frequentist agonizing over what the phrase “probability” means. Confidence intervals are a uniquely frequentist tool. If the distinction on the slide doesn’t make sense to you, look back to the probability video in the preliminaries.</aside><aside    ></aside>

The error bars representing standard deviation don't get smaller, they just get closer to their correct size (which may be very wide around the head of the bar).<br></p><p    >The standard error and the confidence interval are indicators of how confident we are about our estimate <em>of the mean of our data</em>.<em> </em>For these, the more data we have,<em> the smaller they get</em>.

This would allow you to say, for instance, that there is a statistically significant difference between the accuracy estimates on two classifiers. As we said before, such testing is not very popular in machine learning, so we won't go into it in detail, but this can offer an additional perspective on error bars.<br></p><aside    >We won’t discuss the Student’s t test in detail, but it’s a common test for comparing two normally distributed values.<br></aside><p    >Say you plot the mean squared error for regression models <strong class="red">A</strong> and <strong class="blue">B</strong>, together with some error bars.

That is, does it indicate whether we can conclude that <strong class="red">A</strong> is a better model than <strong class="blue">B</strong>?<br></p><p    >Yes, but we have to be careful. For standard error bars, the existence of overlap implies that there is no significant difference between the two effects. That is, the possibility that the difference is due to random chance is high, and a repeat of the experiment on new data may show a different result. If you plot confidence interval error bars, and there is <em>no</em> overlap, you may conclude that the difference between the models is significant. If you repeat the experiment on fresh data, it is very likely that model <strong class="red">A</strong> would beat model <strong class="blue">B</strong> again.<br></p><p    >In both cases, the converse does not hold. If the SEM error bars do not overlap, there may or may not be a significant difference.

            <p    >Another reason to mistrust accuracy is<strong> cost imbalance</strong>. In breast cancer screening are two types of misclassification: diagnosing a healthy person with cancer and diagnosing a person with cancer as healthy. Both come with a cost but not the same cost. <br></p><p    >We can either miss a cancer diagnosis (a <em>false negative</em>), which means the cancer will be caught much later and be much harder to treat. However, diagnosing a healthy person with cancer (a <em>false positive</em>) means they will be sent for unnecessary invasive testing and suffer great psychological stress. The cost of this is much less than the cost of missing a positive, but it isn't zero.<br></p><p    >This is what the discussion in the media centers on. If the screening causes many more false negatives than false positives, it may mean that the cost to human lives balances out, and the net effect of the screening isn't to save more lives.<br></p><p    >There is of course, also the financial cost of screening a large part of the population. Most people would put any financial cost far below the cost of a human life, but if it turns out that the classifier is weak enough that the gains in human lives saved are negligible, we'd look at the financial cost and say the program would need to end.</p><p    ></p>

            <p    >Here are some examples of problems with cost imbalance<br></p><p    >In all these cases, one misclassification one way costs much more than a misclassification the other way. But both cost <em>something</em>. The time of an expert reviewer is not free, even though five minutes of his time may be much cheaper than the cost of letting a single fraud go unchecked. In such a case, you may decide that missing one fraud is as costly as having an expert review 500 harmless transactions. This is then the general balance you are hoping for: one false negative for every 500 false positives.<br></p><p    >If you’re lucky, both types of misclassification have the same unit, and you can turn your error (an estimate of the number of misclassifications) into a domain specific evaluation function (like estimated dollars lost, or time saved). <strong>You simply assign a cost to each type if misclassification, and multiply it by how often that misclassification occurs in the test set. </strong>The total is the evaluation function you want to minimize.<strong><br></strong></p><p    >If the units are not the same (money saved vs. lives saved) making such a choice can seem very unethical if you're literally equating a human life with an amount of money. On the other hand, any classifier you decide to deploy will <em>implicity </em>make such a choice even if you don't do the sums yourself. Even if you decide not to use machine learning, the alternative (a doctor using their own judgement) is also a “classifier”, with its own cost balance.</p><p    ></p>

However if you split off a test set of 1 000 instances, you'd be left with just 50 instances of the<span class="red"> </span><span class="blue">positive</span> class in your data. Practically, your final evaluation will just be a question of how many of these 50 <span class="blue">positives</span> you detect.

            <p    >So far we’ve thought of FPR/TPR and precision/recall as a way to analyze a given<em> set</em> of models.<br></p><p    >However, what if we had a <em>single</em> classifier, but we could control how eager it was to call things <span class="blue">positive</span>? If we made it entirely timid, it would classify nothing as positive and start in the bottom left corner. As it grew more brave, it would start classifying some things as positive, but only if it was really sure, and its true positive rate would go up. If we made it even more daring, it would start getting some things wrong and both the TPR and the FPR would increase. Finally, it would end up classifying everything as positive, and end up on the top right corner. <br></p><p    >The curve this classifier would trace out, would give us an indication of its performance, <em>independent </em>of how brave or how timid we make it. How can we build such a classifier?</p><p    ></p>

            <p    >We can achieve this by turning a regular classifier into a<strong> ranking classifier</strong><em> </em>(also known as a <strong>scoring classifier</strong>). A ranking classifier doesn’t just provide classes, it also gives a <em>score</em> of <em class="red">how</em><span class="red"> negative</span> or <em class="blue">how</em><span class="blue"> positive</span> a point is. We can use this to rank the points from most negative to most positive.<br></p><p    >How to do this depends on the type of model we use. Here’s how to do it for a linear classifier. We simply measure the distance to the decision boundary. We can now scale our classifier from timid to bold by moving the decision boundary from left to right.<br></p><p    >After we have a ranking, we can scale the eagerness of the classifier to make things positive. by moving the threshold (the dotted line) from left to right, the classifier becomes more eager to call things negative. This allows us to trade off the true positive rate and the false positive rate.</p><p    ></p>

They reported 91% ROC-AUC on men and 83% ROC-AUC on women.<br></p><p    >The results were immediately cited as evidence of a biological link between biology and sexual orientation.

            <p    >Let’s go back to the sexuality classifier. What might a Clever Hans effect look like here? In the most extreme case, you might expect a classifier just to look at the background of the image. The authors were more careful here than you might expect:<br></p><p     class="list-item">The background of the image was blurred and the the facial features (eyes, nose, mouth) were detected and aligned. <br></p><p     class="list-item">The focus of the classifier was investigated with saliency maps (indicators of where the model is looking). This is a fallible method, but it does show a general focus on the face. (Still, remember how small the effect was in the saliency map for the chest X-ray.)<br></p><p     class="list-item">A second classifier was fed only facial landmarks: the position of the eyes, roundness of the jaw, etc. That is, the photo was translated to a series of explicit features. The suggestion being that this prevents Clever Hans effects.<br></p><p     class="list-item">The deep neural network used to extract features from pixels was not trained on this data, but on another facial dataset. Only its<em> features </em>were fed to a shallow classifier that learned from these labels. This limits the ability of the classifier to pick up on surface detail.<br></p><p    ></p>

            <p    >Another question we suggested in the last video is whether the target label you’ve chosen is saying what you think it’s saying.<br></p><p    >Here, the authors inferred sexuality from the stated preference in the dating profile. This is clearly correlated with sexuality, but not the same thing. Firstly, sexuality is one of those attributes (like movie genre) that can only be crudely approximated by a set of finite categories. Moreover, for many people it’s not a fixed attribute, and it is subject to some evolution throughout their life.<br></p><p    >The stated preference on a dating profile also means that you are capturing only those gay people who are willing to live (relatively) openly as gay. This may be highly dependent on social background. It’s certainly conceivable that in poorer subcultures, people are less likely to come out as gay, either to their community or to themselves.<br></p><p    >This means that what we’re detecting when we’re classifying a face in this dataset as “gay” is more likely a combination of factors that are correlation to that label.<br></p><p    >Incidentally, note the size of the dataset. One thing the authors can’t be accused of is finding spurious correlations. It’s a question of what the correlations that they found mean, but with this amount of data, as we saw before, we get very small confidence intervals, so the observed effects are definitely there.</p><p    ></p>

That’s most likely to be a grooming choice, based on the differences in gay and heterosexual subcultures. <br></p><p    >For other correlations, such as that between sexuality and nose length, the authors suggest the prenatal hormone theory, a theory that relates prenatal hormone levels in the mother with the sexuality of the subject. In short, a biological mechanism that is responsible for both the (slight) variation in facial features and the variation in sexual preference.<br></p><p    >But that’s not the only possibility. In the previous slide, we saw that it’s difficult to separate facial features from facial expressions. However, even if we somehow eliminate the expression, that doesn’t mean that every facial feature we see is determined at birth. For instance, the roundness of the jaw is also influenced by body weight, which is strongly influenced by social class (for instance, whether somebody grows up poor or rich). And while there’s no evidence that social class influences the probability of <em>being gay</em>, it most likely does influence how likely a gay person is to end up setting up a dating profile.<br></p><aside    >Note that these are purely hypotheses, intended to show which kinds of causalities can cause these correlations.

The idea is that we can detect landmarks very accurately, and classifying on these alone removes a lot of sources for potential Clever Hans effects.<br></p><p    >We see that all subsets of the face landmarks allow for some predictive performance, but there is a clear difference between them. Note that just because we are isolating landmarks, doesn’t mean that we are focusing only on biological causes. As we saw earlier, the shape of the mouth is determined more by expression than by facial features, and the roundness of the jaw is partly determined by body weight, which is correlated with social class.<br></p><p    >We will discuss the AUC metric in the third lecture.

            <p    >To interpret numbers like these, it’s good to get some points of reference. If we try to guess somebody’s gender or sex (the distinction doesn’t matter much for such a crude guess), <strong>while knowing nothing about them except their age</strong>, the best we can expect to do is slightly better than chance level (51% of our guesses will be correct). The reason we can get better than chance level is that women tend to live longer than men. This means that if we guess “female” for older people, we are a little bit more likely to be correct.<br></p><p    >If we restrict ourselves to older people, the effect becomes more pronounced and we can get to the level the sexuality classifier achieved (based purely on noses in the female part of the data). This can help us to interpret the AUC the authors managed to achieve. Note that this accuracy is achieved by calling everybody female, and the AUC is achieved by guessing that the older person in a pair is always female. Think about that. <strong>If you walk into a care home blindfolded and simply call everybody female, can you really claim to be </strong><em>detecting </em><strong>their gender?<br></strong></p><p    >If we look purely at people’s height, we get an accuracy and AUC that is comparable to what the authors achieved from the pixel data. This is also an important point to consider. Height and gender are correlated, but that doesn’t mean that there are no tall women or short men. It also doesn’t make tall women “masculine”, or short men “feminine”. It’s just a slight correlation that allows us to make an educated guess for certain parts of the range of heights.<br></p><p    >This is how you should always interpret accuracy and AUC values in the range 0.8 to 0.95: it's as impressive as guessing somebody's sex or gender based purely on their height. Yes, it can be done better than chance level, and yes there is a definite correlation, but it doesn't much more than that there is a very subtle correlation.<br></p><aside    >NB: In the ANSUR II data, the subjects are soldiers.

I’ll just note some important points to consider.<br></p><p    >Firstly, the authors weren’t looking to prove this point one way or another, and they initially stumbled on to their findings. Given that a result has been established, it’s most often unethical <em>not </em>to report it. So long as that reporting is done carefully and responsibly, of course.<br></p><p    >The stated aim of the paper is not to make any claims about causal mechanisms. The authors are less interested in whether the classifier picks up on grooming choices of biological features, than in whether the guess can be made with some success at all. <br></p><p    >If we decide that the result did need to be reported, we may consider whether the authors were guilty of poor framing. The use of the word <em>detecting </em>is subject to misinterpretation. To be fair, that’s something I only became aware of when looking into this matter including all the fallout from this particular paper, so for me at least it would be hypocritical to be too judgemental of poor word choice.<br></p><p    >Another odd thing, is that in both the paper and the explanatory notes, <em>prenatal hormone theory </em>a suggested biological causal mechanism for homosexuality, is often mentioned. As we have seen the experiments shown here provide no evidence for one causal hypothesis over another, so it would probably have been better to make no claims about causal effect whatsoever.</p><p    ></p>

Call this method <span>C</span>.<br></p><p    >We can also do a ridiculous, counter-intuitive thing and choose the method that performs <em>worst</em>. Call this method <span class="blue">D</span>.<br></p><p    >The no free lunch theorem says that method <span class="blue">D</span> should outperform method <span>C</span> just as often as the other way around. <br></p><p    >The kind of datasets where this happens are the ones where the test set happens to behave very differently from the training set. Since we usually make the split randomly, these would be very unusual or unlikely datasets, and we feel justified in using method <span>C</span>. Still, this only works because we are able to make certain <em>assumptions</em> about our data.</p><p    ></p>

            <p    >In a way, we’re back to the problem of induction. For any given situation where a learning method works, there’s a situation where it doesn’t. Induction (aka. learning from experience) works in practice, but there are exceptions, and we can't tell just by looking at the data when it will and won't work.<br></p><p    >Note that if there were some algorithm that could tell us which situation we were in, we could just use this algorithm to select our learning method, and beat the NFL theorem.<br></p><p    >In short, we need to make some <strong>assumptions</strong> about the nature of whatever it was that created our data. Without such assumptions, learning doesn't work.</p><p    ></p>

            <p    >This is an increasingly important phrase in machine learning. The inductive bias of a method or model are those assumptions about the domain that are, explicitly or implicitly, hardcoded into the model.<br></p><p    >For instance, in a linear regression model, the assumption is that all instances lie on a line (or the higher-dimensional equivalent). If this assumption isn't violated too much, the model is a good fit for the data. If the assumption is violated very badly,  we need to look for ways to change the inductive bias, for instance by picking a different model, or by enriching the linear model with extra features, like we will do in the next lecture.<br></p><p    >We can summarize the business of machine learning and data science as follows. The business of the machine learning researcher is to create a variety of models with helpful inductive biases. The business of the data scientist is to figure out which of the available inductive biases is helpful for any given problem.</p><p    ></p>

            <p    >One “out” to the NFL Theorem, is that there is a “universal distribution” governing all processes that create data.<br></p><p    >The NFL Theorem implicitly assumes that all datasets are equally likely. Since this is not the case, there is some other, non-uniform distribution that tells us which datasets are more likely than others, averaged over all possible settings.<br></p><p    >Using such a universal data distribution, we could (in theory) work out a universally best learning algorithm. </p><p    ></p>

            <p    >We don't have too many practical ideas about the properties of such a universal distribution, but one thing that crops up a lot is that<strong> simple data</strong> is necessarily more likely than complex data.<br></p><p    >This suggests that in learning we should have a <strong>simplicity bias</strong>. If there are two models that both fit the data, one very simple, like a linear model, and one very complex, like a very big decision tree, then it's more likely that the simple model generated the data.<br></p><p    >Such simplicity biases can be implemented in many different ways, and we'll see some concrete examples as the course progresses.</p><p    ></p>

            <p    >Whether or not the NFL theorem means anything for us in practice, it has also given rise to a general <strong>principle</strong>, commonly followed in machine learning practice. The principle is that we should choose our method to deal with the task at hand, and not look for a universally best method.<br></p><p    >Note that this is distinct from the NFL theorem, because everybody still uses data splitting universally to evaluate <em>which of these many methods</em> is the best. And by the NFL theorem, model selection by data splitting is also not a universal algorithm. So the NFL theorem and the NFL principle are really two very different things.<br></p><p    >In practice, the NFL theorem shouldn't keep you awake at night. It's an interesting thought to return to occasionally, and a reminder that by choosing a model, we are making assumptions about the source of our data.<br></p><p    >The NFL <em>principle</em> is an important concept to keep in mind when selecting models. Don't just run gradient boosted decision trees by default, just because somebody somewhere said it was the best approach. Investigate your task. figure out what makes it special, try different approaches and tailor your approach to the problem at hand.<br></p><p    ></p>
